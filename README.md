# Frosthaven Game Tracker

This is a work in progress Frosthaven game companion.
The idea is to let players enter information on their phone, 
but also display it on a central screen, so we don't all have 
our heads down in our phones while we are together playing a tabletop game.

This is also a Rust and Tera Templates experiment for the author.
It is most likely not following many best practices, it gets thrown 
together small piece by small piece in spare time.
